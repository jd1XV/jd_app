# jd_app
This is an in-progress application framework and custom standard library written (mostly) from scratch in C17. 

jd_app is in the very early stages, but is being designed from the ground up with cross-platform compatibility in mind. Right now, it runs on Windows using native Win32 APIs. Versions for Linux and other platforms can be expected as the project develops.

##### Features include:
- Simplified but powerful windowing and graphics capabilities
- Dynamic arrays and strings based around a custom arena allocator.
- Simple data structures utilities to create and manage linked lists, trees, and more
- Simple to use 2D renderer
- Immediate mode UI engine
- Optional dynamic code reloading for live editing of program logic
- ...and much more to come!

*Note that this is a work in progress, and many of these features are immature and liable to change.*
